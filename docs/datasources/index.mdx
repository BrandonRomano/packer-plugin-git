# Git Data Sources

The Git plugin is able to fetch data from Git repositories. 
The following data sources are currently supported:

- [commit](/docs/datasources/git/commit) - Retrieve information
    about a commit, e.g. the commit hash.
- [tree](/docs/datasources/git/tree) - Retrieve the list of 
    files present in a specific commit, similar to `git ls-tree -r`.

## How to use this plugin

From Packer v1.7.0, copy and paste this code into your Packer 
configuration to install this plugin. Then, run 
[`packer init`](/docs/commands/init).

```hcl
packer {
  required_plugins {
    git = {
      version = ">= 0.2.0"
      source = "github.com/ethanmdavidson/git"
    }
  }
}
```

### Manual Installation

You can find pre-built binary releases of the plugin 
[here](https://github.com/ethanmdavidson/packer-plugin-git/releases).

Alternatively, if you prefer to build the plugin from its source 
code, clone [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/ethanmdavidson/packer-plugin-git)
locally and run the command `make build` from the root
directory. Upon successful compilation, a `packer-plugin-git` plugin
binary file can be found in the root directory.

Once the binary is downloaded or built, please follow the Packer 
documentation on
[installing a plugin](https://www.packer.io/docs/extending/plugins/#installing-plugins).
